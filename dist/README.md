# grafana-tolleiv-dev-panel
A custom panel derrived from the singlestat panel - just the functionality I needed.

This repo will serve as an example on developing custom panels for Grafana which has more than just trivial functionality.
It's based on the official [Singlestat](http://docs.grafana.org/features/panels/singlestat/) panel but removes a lot.
